### [BitBuffer](https://github.com/Nak2/NikNaks/wiki/BitBuffer)
------
BitBuffers are simelar to file-objects as they store data in a 32-bit number-array.
* They offer speeds up to 80x faster than the regular file-IO system. As they skip the Lua -> C -> Lua header.
* Little/Big Endian support
* Allows for non-byte integers
* Supports Float / Dobule.
* Have additional features, structures and allows to be loaded entirely in memory.
* Can both Read and Write at the same time.

>***Note:** BitBuffers have some limits, as reading and writing strings tent to be faster using the file-IO.
